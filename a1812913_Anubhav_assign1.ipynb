Let me just say that this book is beyond painful to read. I couldn\\'t get to the end no matter how hard I tried.All of these glowing reviews here make me wonder about my sanity. I enjoy James Bond and a knock off would not be unwelcome. However, if you ever turn on AMC or watch old flicks from the late 60\\'s, early 70\\'s, you will occasionally see a movie with Lee Marvin or some other B actor playing the part of a Hammy James Bond. James Coburn played perhaps the worst knock off in my book with his roll as \"\"flint\"\". This was a hugely successful series back in its day, but try and watch it now and your in for a hard time. Bad acting, silly plot, demeaning towards women, insanely over the top character development... all of this you will find in Eiger Sanction.This is just a really bad book.\\n',\n",

The first eight tracks are good enough; the last five will blow you away.The first movement is a good introduction to the whole thing. The second sports some good soloing and wonderful rhythm section interplay during the vibes solo. The third movement is absolutely amazing in its expressive dynamic range. The extended drum solos in the fourth movement of the suite are a bit long for my tastes, but that's just me. The fifth and final movement has an interesting, obvious, and pretty funny mistake by a member of the trumpet section that, quite surprisingly, doesn't ruin the tune at all.

That is the way it was written and to do it any other way would have been an insult to the original creative team. Mr. Parker\\'s direction and the screenplay are far superior to the stage version.

It was very clean and edited. It felt as though I were a 5 year old reading this book. Also, it was incredibly unrealistic, to violent, and to dumb. This is a book that can NEVER be made into a movie, and if it was made into one, i and several other friends would not go.

His distinctive voice is so part of Crue's music that fans will not be happy to have someone else filling the role of lead singer (the reason why the previous album with Corabi was unsuccessful even though it had been a great album). With this album, the Crue moves away from the dark and heavy style of the past to something more industrial and experimental.

The idea behind the movie is sort of cool and ahead of its time, being that is was released in theaters in 1989. I think that is the only real positive thing I can say about this film. As far as acting goes, the movie stars Jill Schoelen and Tom Villard as the main charecters, and the acting is terrible and unconvincing. Also, the movie is not scary at all, in fact they try to make it funny by adding jokes. This is definitly not for the hard core horror fan, but maybe fans of the Scream and Urban Legend type of horror movies might find something special in this movie.

The underwater photography in this movie is stunningly lucid (and plays better in black and white than some of the color underwater stuff shot today). Julie Adams's swimming is equally lucid and graceful. Rico Brown (a professional swimmer himself) plays The Creature and is mezmorizing in his underwater fight scenes.

Having made this realization, I switched to Bruce Eckel's _Thinking In Java_ (3rd ed.) and am delighted with it. You can easily execute his sample code along with your reading and modify as needed to experiement. His explanations of the language are to the point and clear for people who are already familiar with OO programming.

I work with First Step, a nonprofit organization to help the victims of domestic violence break out of abusive relationships. I have seen abusive men scream that the woman had 'clawed his face' or 'slapped' him. From experience I can say that nine times out of ten this 'abuse' is done out of fear, often when the abuser has the victem pinned against the wall. A case I just assisted on involved a woman who slapped her husband after he had pinned her to a wall. He punched her in the face and broke the woman's nose. He still maintains that he was in the right, and that he was the abused. This is a techinque of power, of making the woman feel guilty and weak. No violence is acceptable, but making the claim that men are abused to a larger extent than women only helps further sterotypes benificial to violent men.\\n\",\n",

I believe the actual measurements for the liners are 11x17x7--a rectangular shape (that tapers out from the base), not a square shape as someone else had noted in their review. They are very cute and accent the rest of the collection very well, but it wasn't very economical for me to purchase new baskets to try to accommodate the size of these (I had a difficult time finding baskets of that size anyway). Bottomline: If you already have baskets that will work with the dimensions of the liners, absolutely get them--they are great; if not, getting a set of baskets with liners in sage, red, or even blue or muslin would all complement the bedding set very nicely without being as expensive.\\n\",\n",

Flash sync of 1/500th makes life easier on your flash when doing fill-flash on a sunny day.The only reason it doesn't get five stars is the lack of flash exposure lock. This is where you can fire the preflash and lock the exposure values, so when you press the shutter it doesn't have to preflash. My wife blinks quickly, so every shot has her eyes closed. My solution was to get an SB-800 flash that can use an Auto-Aperture flash mode that doesn't need preflash, which works beautifully. It would have been nice to just use flash exposure lock, though.

I always thought she was a fairly intelligent actress who could pick out decent roles but she has made some really bad choices recently. And if there is a more unfunny, uninteresting film than this, I don't think I've seen it. Or a tv sitcom, for that matter. It is a mess.I did like seeing Kline again, he is always good but really all it did was remind me of all his good films over the years I would rather have been watching.And there is no question Natalie Portman is nice to look at. So I give it two stars for Portman's looks and Kline, zero stars for Kuchter (he is an insufferably bad actor in every way and should never make another film or tv show ever) which averages out to a one star.\\n\",\n",

              " \"__label__2 The Black Dahlia Files: the Mob, the Mogul, and the Murder that Transfixed Los Angeles: This book is stock full of both good research and good writing. Don Wolfe takes the reader on a trip back in time to the corrupt and seamy Los Angeles of the 1940's inwhich one of America's most gruesome and famous murders occurred. The book brings us inside the police department and the competing newspapers and, with the addition of some key living sources and papers recently released, arrives at a conclusion. I believe Mr. Wolfe has solved the unsolved case of Elizabeth Short, the Black Dahlia. The author manages to lay out the results of his investigation in most readable prose inwhich he includes his own story of growing up in Los Angeles. He does this to add to the storyline rather than intruding on it. This is a well written piece of great investigative journalism that I believe any reader of true crime stories will find fascinating. BRAVO FOR A JOB WELL DONE.\\n\",\n",

According to Jon Cryer(Lenny Luthor), the film was released before post-production even really was underway, so it\\'s no wonder that the effects are so terrible. They aren\\'t finished! They are in the film exactly as they looked on the sets, which is very fake(even Star Wars and Raiders would have looked phony if the post-production work was never completed). A CGI restoration would literally work a miracle. It would turn the worst film in the series into at least the third best, and if visually stunning, maybe the best(doubtful, but who knows). The actors are all good, and the basic story is clever. C\\'mon, Warners, do a CGI Restoration, and salvage this film!

              " '__label__2 The US Coast Guard was in contact with the Andrea Gail: This exciting book, a summary of the sinking of the Gloucester fishing boat Andrea Gail in the huge Halloween storm of 1991, is based on much interesting anecdotal information, since there were no survivors among the crew of six, and no contact with the boat as the storm progressed. No contact? An aquaintance who was in the US Coast Guard at the time in New England told me that they were in contact with the Andrea Gail for 18 hours before she went down. Unfortunately for Sebastian Junger\\'s extensive research effort, the military keeps many secrets. This is a gripping and educational account of a sea disaster even without the actual, final details\"\\n',\n",
